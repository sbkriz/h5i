# h5i

> **The version control layer for the age of AI-generated code.**

`h5i` (pronounced *high-five*) is a Git sidecar that extends version control beyond text history. Where Git answers *what changed*, h5i answers *who changed it, why, whether it was safe, and how to undo it semantically*.

Built for teams where AI agents write production code alongside humans.

---

## The Problem

Modern AI coding agents — Claude, Copilot, Cursor — generate tens of thousands of lines of code per day. Git was designed for humans. It has no concept of:

- **Provenance** — was this written by a human or an AI, and with what prompt?
- **Intent alignment** — did the agent actually do what was asked?
- **Semantic rollback** — "undo the AI change that broke authentication" not "revert commit `a3f9c2b`"
- **Integrity** — did the agent quietly touch CI/CD files, leak credentials, or remove safety checks?
- **Concurrent agents** — how do two AI agents edit the same file without corrupting each other's work?

h5i is the missing infrastructure layer.

---

## Five Dimensions of Software Truth

Traditional Git tracks code as a one-dimensional stream of text through time. h5i operates across five dimensions simultaneously:

```
① Temporal    ──  Git history, commit lineage, parent chains
② Structural  ──  AST-level change tracking (S-expression hashes)
③ Intentional ──  AI prompt, model, agent ID, token usage
④ Empirical   ──  Test suite hashes, coverage metrics
⑤ Associative ──  CRDT-based collaborative editing (Yjs/Yrs)
```

Every commit carries metadata across all five axes. The result is a commit log that answers not just *what* changed but *how* and *why* — machine-readable, auditable, and rollback-able by intent.

---

## Features

**AI Provenance Tracking**
Captures the prompt, model name, agent ID, and token usage alongside every commit. The prompt is captured automatically from Claude Code via a hook — no manual `--prompt` flag required.

**Rule-Based Integrity Engine**
Twelve deterministic, human-auditable rules that run before every `--audit` commit. No AI involvement in the audit path. Rules detect credential leaks, dangerous execution patterns, CI/CD tampering, scope creep, and more.

**Intent-Based Rollback**
Describe what you want to undo in plain English. h5i uses Claude to semantically match your description against stored prompts and commit messages, then reverts the right commit — no commit hash needed.

**CRDT Collaborative Sessions**
File-level Yjs documents allow multiple AI agents to edit concurrently with strong eventual consistency. Conflicts resolve mathematically, not by coin flip.

**Semantic Blame**
Line-level and AST-level blame that surfaces the original AI prompt and test status alongside authorship — not just a commit hash.

## Installation

Requires Rust 1.70+ and an existing Git repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/koukyosyumei/h5i
cd h5i
cargo build --release
cp target/release/h5i /usr/local/bin/
```

Initialize h5i in any Git repository:

```bash
cd your-project
h5i init
# → h5i sidecar initialized at .git/.h5i
```

---

## Usage

### Committing with AI Provenance

```bash
# Explicit flags
h5i commit -m "implement rate limiting" \
  --prompt "add per-IP rate limiting to the auth endpoint" \
  --model claude-sonnet-4-6 \
  --agent claude-code

# Or set environment variables — flags are then optional
export H5I_MODEL=claude-sonnet-4-6
export H5I_AGENT_ID=claude-code
h5i commit -m "implement rate limiting"
```

With the Claude Code hook installed (see below), `--prompt` is captured automatically from your conversation — zero friction.

### Auditing Before Commit

```bash
h5i commit -m "refactor auth module" --audit
```

```
⚠ INTEGRITY WARNING (score: 0.70)
  ⚠ [UNDECLARED_DELETION]  247 lines deleted (72% of total changes) with no deletion intent stated.
  ℹ [CONFIG_FILE_MODIFIED]  Configuration file 'config/auth.yaml' modified.
```

Use `--force` to commit despite warnings. Violations block the commit by default.

### Enriched Commit Log

```bash
h5i log --limit 5
```

```
commit a3f9c2b14...
Author:   Alice <alice@example.com>
Agent:    claude-code (claude-sonnet-4-6) 󱐋
Prompt:   "implement per-IP rate limiting on the auth endpoint"
Tests:    ✔ 94.2%

    implement rate limiting

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
```

### Semantic Blame

```bash
h5i blame src/auth.rs
h5i blame src/auth.rs --mode ast   # AST-level semantic blame
```

```
STAT COMMIT   AUTHOR/AGENT    | CONTENT
✅ ✨ a3f9c2b  claude-code     | fn validate_token(tok: &str) -> bool {
✅    a3f9c2b  claude-code     |     tok.len() == 64 && tok.chars().all(|c| c.is_ascii_hexdigit())
      9eff001  alice           | }
```

### Intent-Based Rollback

```bash
h5i rollback "the OAuth login changes"
```

```
🔍 Searching for intent: "the OAuth login changes" across last 50 commits
   Using Claude for semantic search (claude-haiku-4-5-20251001)

Matched commit:
  commit 7d2f1a9e3b...
  Message:   add OAuth login with GitHub provider
  Agent:     claude-code (claude-sonnet-4-6)
  Prompt:    "implement OAuth login flow with GitHub as the identity provider"
  Date:      2026-03-10 14:22 UTC

Revert this commit? [y/N]
```

```bash
# Dry run to preview without reverting
h5i rollback "rate limiting" --dry-run

# Skip confirmation in CI
h5i rollback "the broken migration" --yes
```

Falls back to keyword search if `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is not set.

### CRDT Collaborative Sessions

Start a real-time recording session for a file. Each agent gets its own session; changes are merged via CRDT automatically.

```bash
h5i session --file src/auth.rs
# → Watching for changes... (Press Ctrl+C to stop)
```

### CRDT Merge Resolution

```bash
h5i resolve <ours-oid> <theirs-oid> src/auth.rs
```

Resolves conflicts using the mathematical CRDT state stored in Git Notes — no interactive merge editor required.

## Integrity Engine

The `--audit` flag runs twelve deterministic rules against the staged diff before committing. Rules are pure string/stat checks — no AI, no network, no false trust.

| Rule | Severity | Trigger |
|------|----------|---------|
| `CREDENTIAL_LEAK` | **Violation** | Added line contains credential keyword + assignment + quoted value, or PEM header |
| `CODE_EXECUTION` | **Violation** | Added non-comment line contains `eval()`, `exec()`, `os.system()`, `subprocess.*`, etc. |
| `CI_CD_MODIFIED` | **Violation** | `.github/workflows/`, `Jenkinsfile`, etc. modified without CI/CD intent in prompt |
| `SENSITIVE_FILE_MODIFIED` | Warning | `.env`, `.pem`, `.key`, `id_rsa`, `credentials` in diff |
| `LOCKFILE_MODIFIED` | Warning | `Cargo.lock`, `package-lock.json`, `go.sum` changed without dependency intent |
| `UNDECLARED_DELETION` | Warning | >60% of changes are deletions with no deletion/refactor intent stated |
| `SCOPE_EXPANSION` | Warning | Prompt names a specific file but other source files were also modified |
| `LARGE_DIFF` | Warning | >500 total lines changed — difficult for humans to audit |
| `REFACTOR_ANOMALY` | Warning | "refactor" intent but insertions are 3× or more the deletions |
| `PERMISSION_CHANGE` | Warning | `chmod 777`, `sudo`, `setuid`, `chown root` in added lines |
| `BINARY_FILE_CHANGED` | Info | Binary file appears in diff |
| `CONFIG_FILE_MODIFIED` | Info | `.yaml`, `.toml`, `.json`, `.ini` etc. modified |

**Why rule-based?** AI-generated code should be audited by deterministic rules that humans can read and reason about. A fuzzy ML classifier would itself be a trust problem.

To extend the engine: add a `pub const` to `rule_id`, write one pure `fn check_*(ctx: &DiffContext) -> Vec<RuleFinding>` function, and register it in `run_all_rules`. No other changes needed.

## Claude Code Integration

h5i can capture your prompt automatically every time you submit a message to Claude Code, with zero manual intervention.

```bash
h5i install-hooks
```

This prints:
1. A shell script to save at `~/.claude/hooks/h5i-capture-prompt.sh`
2. The exact `~/.claude/settings.json` snippet to register the hook

After setup, the prompt flows from your conversation → `.git/.h5i/pending_context.json` → consumed and cleared by the next `h5i commit`. No flags, no copy-paste.

**Environment variable fallback** (works without hooks, or with any AI agent):

```bash
export H5I_PROMPT="implement rate limiting on the auth endpoint"
export H5I_MODEL="claude-sonnet-4-6"
export H5I_AGENT_ID="claude-code"
h5i commit -m "add rate limiting"
```

Resolution order at commit time: CLI flag → env var → pending context file.

---

## How It Works

h5i stores all metadata as a Git sidecar — nothing lives outside your repository.

```
.git/
└── .h5i/
    ├── ast/                  # SHA-256-keyed S-expression AST snapshots
    ├── metadata/             # Per-commit JSON records (legacy)
    ├── crdt/                 # Yjs CRDT document state
    ├── delta/                # Append-only CRDT update logs (per file)
    └── pending_context.json  # Transient: consumed at next commit
```

Extended commit metadata is stored in Git Notes (`refs/notes/commits`) as JSON, so it travels with the repository on push/fetch and is visible via standard Git tooling.
