`h5i` (pronounced *high-five*) is a Git sidecar that extends version control for teams where AI agents write production code alongside humans. Where Git answers *what changed*, h5i answers *who changed it, why, whether it was safe, and how to undo it*.

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/Koukyosyumei/h5i h5i-core
cd your-project && h5i init
```

## Example Use Cases

### 1. Find out who wrote this — and with what prompt

```bash
h5i blame src/auth.rs
```

```
STAT COMMIT   AUTHOR/AGENT    | CONTENT
✅ ✨ a3f9c2b  claude-code     | fn validate_token(tok: &str) -> bool {
✅    a3f9c2b  claude-code     |     tok.len() == 64 && tok.chars().all(|c| c.is_ascii_hexdigit())
      9eff001  alice           | }
```

```bash
h5i log --limit 3
```

```
commit a3f9c2b...
Author:  Alice <alice@example.com>
Agent:   claude-code (claude-sonnet-4-6) ✨
Prompt:  "add per-IP rate limiting to the auth endpoint"
Tests:   ✔ 42 passed, 0 failed, 1.23s [pytest]

    implement rate limiting
```

Every commit carries the exact prompt, model, agent ID, and test results from when the code was written. Use `h5i serve` to browse it all in a web dashboard.

---

### 2. Undo an AI change — by describing it, not by hash

```bash
h5i rollback "the OAuth login changes"
```

```
Matched commit:
  a3f9c2b  add OAuth login with GitHub provider
  Agent:   claude-code  ·  Prompt: "implement OAuth login flow with GitHub"
  Date:    2026-03-10 14:22 UTC

Revert this commit? [y/N]
```

h5i matches your description against stored prompts and commit messages. No commit hash needed. Use `--dry-run` to preview, `--yes` to skip confirmation in CI.

---

### 3. Audit what the integrity engine caught

```bash
h5i commit -m "refactor auth module" --audit
```

```
⚠ INTEGRITY WARNING (score: 0.70)
  ⚠ [UNDECLARED_DELETION]  247 lines deleted (72% of total changes) with no deletion intent stated.
  ℹ [CONFIG_FILE_MODIFIED]  Configuration file 'config/auth.yaml' modified.
```

Twelve deterministic rules — no AI in the audit path — check for credential leaks, CI/CD tampering, scope creep, dangerous `eval()` patterns, and more. Use `--force` to commit despite warnings.

---

### 4. Understand what Claude actually did in a session

After a Claude Code session, analyze the conversation log:

```bash
h5i notes analyze      # auto-detect most recent session
h5i notes footprint    # which files did Claude read vs. edit?
```

```

### 5. Keep Claude's context alive across sessions

Long-running tasks lose context after a session ends. The `h5i context` workspace gives Claude a version-controlled notepad that survives resets.

```bash
# At project start — Claude runs this once
h5i context init --goal "Build an OAuth2 login system"

# During the session — Claude records its reasoning
h5i context trace --kind OBSERVE "Redis p99 latency is 2 ms"
h5i context trace --kind THINK   "40 MB overhead is acceptable"
h5i context trace --kind ACT     "Switching session store to Redis"

# After each meaningful milestone
h5i context commit "Implemented token refresh flow" \
  --detail "Added automatic refresh using stored refresh token; handles 401s transparently."

# At the start of every new session — Claude restores its state
h5i context show --trace
```

```
── Context ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
  Project: Build an OAuth2 login system  (branch: main)

  Milestones:
    ✔ [x] Initial setup
    ○ [ ] Token refresh flow

  Recent Commits:
    ◈ Added automatic access-token refresh

  Recent Trace:
    [14:22:01] ACT: Switching session store to Redis in src/session.rs
```

Use `h5i context branch` and `h5i context merge` to explore risky alternatives without losing the main thread — just like `git branch`.

To get a ready-made system prompt that tells Claude how to use these commands:

```bash
h5i context prompt
```

---

### 6. Start the next session with full situational awareness

Before beginning a new AI session, run:

```bash
h5i resume              # briefing for the current branch
h5i resume feat/oauth   # briefing for a specific branch
```

```

No AI API call is needed — every field comes from locally stored h5i data: Git notes, the context workspace, session log analysis, and memory snapshots.

### 7. Share AI history with your team

h5i metadata lives in Git refs that aren't pushed by default. Push everything at once:

```bash
h5i push           # sends refs/notes/commits + refs/h5i/memory to origin
git push origin main
```

Teammates fetch and immediately see full AI provenance in `h5i log`:

```bash
git pull           # works automatically if fetch refspecs are configured (see MANUAL.md)
h5i log            # Alice's prompts, models, test results — all visible
```

---

### 8. Browse everything in the web dashboard

```bash
h5i serve        # opens http://localhost:7150
```

<img src="./assets/screenshot_h5i_server.png" alt="h5i web dashboard — Timeline tab">

The **Timeline** tab shows every commit with its full AI context inline. In the screenshot above:

- **Top bar** — 8 commits, all AI-assisted, 100% test pass rate at a glance
- **Commit card** — model (`claude-sonnet-4-6`), agent (`claude-code`), test badge (✔ 36, pytest, 1.32s), and the exact prompt in orange italics
- **Expanded detail** — full test results table (passed / failed / skipped / duration / tool) and a one-click **Re-audit** button that runs all 12 integrity rules against that commit's diff
- **Integrity score** — `Valid · 100%` when all rules pass; shows findings inline if any trigger
- **Left sidebar** — live repo stats (total vs AI-authored commits, AI ratio) and a test-health sparkline across all loaded commits
- **Filter pills** — `🤖 AI only`, `🧪 With tests`, `✖ Failing` to slice the history instantly

The **Summary**, **Integrity**, **Intent Graph**, **Memory**, and **Sessions** tabs give deeper views into the same data. See [MANUAL.md](MANUAL.md#12-web-dashboard) for the full tab guide.
